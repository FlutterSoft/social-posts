## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** EJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, MongoDB, Heroku

The CRUD API uses Node.JS with Express. Served by server to client using EJS as the templating language. Bootstrap used as CSS framework. MongoDB used for database. 

## Optimizations

Could allow users to select profile image.  Haven't learnt how to show updated information without reloading entire page

## Lessons Learned:

Learning how to create and use CRUD API's using Node.JS and Express as well as serving up EJS to client.
